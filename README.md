# RSA Algorithm Encryption and Decryption

This repository contains the implementation of RSA encryption and decryption algorithms for a cryptography course assignment. The code is written in Python and provides a comprehensive understanding of the RSA algorithm and its applications.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the terminal in the repository folder
3. Run the following command: `python rsa_encryption_decryption.py`
4. There is a menu to choose the option to perform encryption or decryption.
5. Input for plain message or ciphered message received in hashed form, in integer.
6. Program give options for the public key (e, euler(n)) to be used for the encyption and decryption.
